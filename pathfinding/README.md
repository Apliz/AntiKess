# The repository for all pathfinding algorithms

### The plan

The plan will be to usean existing pathfinding algorithm. So far the 3 main candidates are:

1. Djikstra's algorithm
2. Travelling salesman
    - Cristophedes algorithm
    - 3 opt optimising
    - Pheremone algorithm
3. A*

These are not necessarily the algorithms I will go with in the end, but these are the best options **so far**

Implement these bad boys in order from 'least' complicated to most. 
This is going to need a lot of research so go _slowly_.

### Order of operations

First thing is to **research the different algorithms**  
Explore their different applications, **will I be able to use it 'out of the box'**?  
What is the **difficulty** of implementation of the algorithm and the **time complexity** of the algorithm. **is it worth it?**  
Establish an **order** in which the algorithms will be implemented.  
For each algorithm what is the **minimum version** that can be developed, does this change anything?
What is the **standard way** of plannign these things? Use that!
