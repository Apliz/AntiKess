Need to find a way to create an Orbit() object for the transfer orbit. 
It would get rid of the duplicate semi-major-axis function and make the calculation pattern for the velocities more uniform.

Define the problem: Clearly specify the variables associated with each node and the objective function you want to minimize.

Design a custom algorithm: Given that this problem doesn't fit directly into existing shortest path algorithms, you may need to devise your own algorithm. This could involve a combination of graph traversal techniques and optimization methods.

Consider the trade-offs: Since you're optimizing two variables simultaneously (shortest path length and the variable associated with each node), you'll likely encounter trade-offs. You may need to define a weighted objective function that balances between minimizing the two variables.

Implement and test: Once you have a clear algorithmic approach, implement it in your preferred programming language and test it with different inputs to ensure it behaves as expected.

Things to do
1. replace JQuery celestrack request with python requests
2. Rework entire database system. It doesn't need to be so bloated.
3. Refactor Transfer.py so that it creates a new Orbit() object for the transfer orbit,
